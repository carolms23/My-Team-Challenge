## Overview

![screenshot](img/team.gif)

The page for project is hosted on GitHub Pages: [My-team-Challenge](https://carolms23.github.io/My-Team-Challenge/)

For project I used only HTML and CSS, mainly with properties that helps responsiveness, such as Grid and Flexbox.

I've learned more about using figcaption rotate and writing-mode CSS. :)
